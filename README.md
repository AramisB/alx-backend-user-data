Personally Identifiable Information (PII):
PII refers to any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. This includes information that can directly identify a person (like their name, Social Security Number, or email address) or information that can be combined with other data to identify a person.
Examples of PII: Full name, date of birth, address, phone number, email address, passport number, social security number, biometric data.

Non-PII:
Non-PII is information that cannot be used on its own to identify a specific individual. It's typically aggregated or anonymized data that poses no risk to privacy when shared.
Examples of Non-PII: Gender, zip code (without additional identifiers), browser type, time of visit.

Personal Data:
This is a broader term that includes any information related to an identifiable person. It encompasses both PII and other data types that might not directly identify someone but still pertain to them.
Examples of Personal Data: Device identifiers, cookies, IP addresses, or any data that, combined with other pieces, could lead to identification.
