Personally Identifiable Information (PII):
PII refers to any data that could potentially identify a specific individual. This includes information that can directly identify a person (like their name, Social Security Number, or email address) or information that can be combined with other data to identify a person.
Examples of PII: Full name, date of birth, address, phone number, email address, passport number, social security number, biometric data.

Non-PII:
Non-PII is information that cannot be used on its own to identify a specific individual. It's typically aggregated or anonymized data that poses no risk to privacy when shared.
Examples of Non-PII: Gender, zip code (without additional identifiers), browser type, time of visit.

Personal Data:
This is a broader term that includes any information related to an identifiable person. It encompasses both PII and other data types that might not directly identify someone but still pertain to them.
Examples of Personal Data: Device identifiers, cookies, IP addresses, or any data that, combined with other pieces, could lead to identification.

Logging Documentation
Logging is crucial for debugging, monitoring, and auditing applications. Good logging practices involve:

Logging errors and exceptions.
Capturing detailed information at different log levels.
Protecting sensitive information like PII by avoiding it in logs or obfuscating it.

bcrypt Package
bcrypt is a password hashing function designed for security, using a hashing algorithm that adapts over time by increasing the computational complexity.

Installation: pip install bcrypt

To hash a password:
import bcrypt

password = b"mysecretpassword"
hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt())

To check a password:
if bcrypt.checkpw(password, hashed):
    print("Password is correct")
else:
    print("Password is incorrect")

Logging to Files, Setting Levels, and Formatting
Logging to Files:

To log to files, you can configure the logger with a FileHandler.
Setting Levels:
Logging levels include DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, controlling what gets logged.

Formatting:
Use formatters to define the structure of log messages. Example:
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log',
                    level=logging.DEBUG,
                    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

Implementing a Log Filter That Will Obfuscate PII Fields
To create a log filter that obfuscates PII fields, you can use Python's logging capabilities:

Example:
import logging
import re

class PiiFilter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record):
        record.msg = re.sub(r'\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b', '***-**-****', record.msg)  # Obfuscate SSNs
        record.msg = re.sub(r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b', '[email protected]', record.msg)  # Obfuscate emails
        return True

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.addFilter(PiiFilter())

logger.info('User email is [emailÂ protected] and SSN is 123-45-6789.')

Encrypting a Password and Check the Validity of an Input Password
Using bcrypt:

Encrypt:
import bcrypt

password = b"supersecret"
hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt())

Validate:
if bcrypt.checkpw(b"supersecret", hashed):
    print("Password is valid!")
else:
    print("Invalid password.")

Authenticating a Database Using Environment Variables
Using environment variables is a best practice for storing sensitive information, like database credentials:

Example with Python and MongoDB:

import os
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Load environment variables
db_user = os.getenv('DB_USER')
db_password = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
db_host = os.getenv('DB_HOST', 'localhost')
db_name = os.getenv('DB_NAME', 'mydatabase')

# Connect to the database
client = MongoClient(f"mongodb://{db_user}:{db_password}@{db_host}/{db_name}")
db = client[db_name]

Environment Variables: Store these in a .env file or your deployment environment, and load them with python-dotenv or through the system environment.
This approach ensures your application remains secure and scalable by keeping sensitive credentials out of your codebase.
